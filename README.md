# Description
Just a vibe-coder ripping off and mashing together the work of https://github.com/imwaitingnow/JDownloader2-jdproxies-creator and https://github.com/MuRongPIG/Proxy-Master to provide fresh proxy lists for JD2 and Megabasterd. 

Great work by both authors. I'm not much of a coder and my contribution here is very minimal:
- Added a few more proxy list sources
- Used AI to tweak the original script
- Used AI to create a workflow that automates the scraping, validation, and generation of proxy lists

# Function

This repository contains a script for fetching, validating, and saving proxies in a format compatible with JDownloader2 and Megabasterd.
It gathers proxies from my Proxy Master fork (https://github.com/rriordan/Proxy-Master), validates their functionality, and outputs the valid ones in a structured JSON format for use in JDownloader2, as well as in IP:Port txt file format for use in Megabasterd. 

Proxy lists are available all together or by protocol.
